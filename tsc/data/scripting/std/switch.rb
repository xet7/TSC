module Std

  # A switch that can be activated by jumping onto it. This class can either
  # be used to create entirely new switches or attach switch functionality to
  # an already switch sprite.
  #
  # Usage example (where the sprite with UID 14 is a pow sprite):
  #
  #   Std::Switch.new(UIDS[14]) do
  #     puts "Switch activated!"
  #   end
  #
  # Creating a new switch:
  #
  #   Std::Switch.new(x: 200, y: -200) do
  #     puts "Switch activated!"
  #   end
  class Switch

    # The underlying Sprite instance.
    attr_reader :sprite

    # The color of the pow switch.
    attr_reader :color

    # call-seq:
    #   new(){...}       → a_switch
    #   new(sprite){...} → a_switch
    #   new(opts){...}   → a_switch
    #
    # Create a new switch. If no parameters are given,
    # a switch is created at position (0|0).
    #
    # == Parameters
    # [sprite]
    #   Use this Sprite instance as the switch. The sprite should
    #   have its image set to "ground/underground/pow.png".
    # [opts]
    #   An option hash with the following keys:
    #   [sprite]
    #     Same as the +sprite+ parameter above.
    #   [x]
    #     Move the switch to this X position.
    #   [y]
    #     Move the switch to this Y position.
    #   [color]
    #     Color of the switch. Defaults to <tt>:blue</tt>.
    #   If not sprite is passed, setting +x+ and +y+ is recommended,
    #   this will be used as the creation position for the new sprite.
    #
    # If a block is given, use that block as the action to execute
    # when the switch gets activated.
    #
    # == Return value
    # The newly created instance.
    def initialize(opts = {}, &block)
      @activated = false
      @callback = block || lambda{puts "Dummy switch."}

      # If a single sprite was given, transform for uniform opts handling
