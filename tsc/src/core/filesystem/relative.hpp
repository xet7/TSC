 * This file adds a function fs_relative() to boost::filesystem that
 * allows us to create a relative path from a given “root”, i.e. the
 * common parts of both paths are missing in the returned path object.
 *
 * Boost >= 1.60.0 includes such a function, but for the sake of
 * supporting older versions as well we provide our own version
 * here.
