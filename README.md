The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.
===============================

“The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.” is a 2D sidecrolling platform game,
with a rich set of graphics, music, and an advanced level editor that
allows you to create your own levels. The level editor allows for
in-game scripting so there are no borders apart from your imagination.

The project is a fork of [SMC](http://www.secretmaryo.org), which is
not developed actively anymore. Note this is not merely a continuation
of SMC, but we have our own goals and design principles we are slowly
integrating into both the codebase and the artwork.

How to install?
---------------

Releases are published precompiled for Windows at the website. If you

Contributing
------------

Any contributions to the code, the graphics, the music, etc. are
greatly appreciated. However, before starting your work on the game,
please consider the following:

* You have to be familiar with at least the basics of using the Git
  version control system. This can be achieved by reading the first
  two chapters of [this great online Git
  book](http://git-scm.com/book). Also reading chapter 3 is highly
  recommended as we use branches all the time.
* If you want to contribute code, please read [the coding
  conventions document](http://docs.secretchronicles.de/api/devel/md_conventions.html)
* If you want to contribute artistic work, please read [the styleguide](http://wiki.secretchronicles.de/StyleGuide)
* If you specifically target issues from the issue tracker, please
  use “fixes #43” for bug tickets you fix and “closes #43” for other
  tickets you resolve as part of the message in your commits. This
  causes GitHub to automatically close the corresponding ticket if
  we merge your changes.
