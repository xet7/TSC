The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.
===============================

“The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.” is a 2D sidecrolling platform game,
with a rich set of graphics, music, and an advanced level editor that
allows you to create your own levels. The level editor allows for
in-game scripting so there are no borders apart from your imagination.

The project is a fork of [SMC](http://www.secretmaryo.org), which is
not developed actively anymore. Note this is not merely a continuation
of SMC, but we have our own goals and design principles we are slowly
integrating into both the codebase and the artwork.

How to install?
---------------

Releases are published precompiled for Windows at the website. If you

Contributing
------------

Any contributions to the code, the graphics, the music, etc. are
greatly appreciated. However, before starting your work on the game,
please consider the following:

* You have to be familiar with at least the basics of using the Git
  version control system. This can be achieved by reading the first
  two chapters of [this great online Git
  book](http://git-scm.com/book). Also reading chapter 3 is highly
  recommended as we use branches all the time.
* If you want to contribute code, please read [the coding
  conventions document](http://www.secretchronicles.de/docs/2.0.0/cpp/md_docs_pages_conventions.html)
* If you want to contribute artistic work, please read [the styleguide](http://wiki.secretchronicles.de/StyleGuide.html)
* If you specifically target issues from the issue tracker, please
  use “fixes #43” for bug tickets you fix and “closes #43” for other
  tickets you resolve as part of the message in your commits. This
  causes GitHub to automatically close the corresponding ticket if
  we merge your changes.

Custom local configurations are provided for Emacs and ViM. In order for local
ViM configurations to work, you will need the localvimrc plugin, which can be
installed with the following command on most Bourne-compatible shells:

~~~sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
cd ~/.vim/plugin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/embear/vim-localvimrc/master/plugin/localvimrc.vim
~~~
